### 🚨 Port 73001 Note

**Original Requirement**: Deploy on port 73001

**Docker Issue**: Docker doesn't support port 73001 (likely due to port range limitations)

**Solution Implemented**: Deployed on port 7301 instead

**Alternative Solutions for Port 73001**:

1. **Use Docker Compose with custom networking**:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  tetris-kids:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.simple
    container_name: tetris-kids-game
    ports:
      - "7301:3000"  # Use 7301 as closest alternative
    restart: unless-stopped
```

2. **Use a reverse proxy (nginx/traefik) to map port 73001**:
```bash
# Install nginx locally and configure proxy
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/tetris-kids
server {
    listen 73001;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:7301;
    }
}
```

3. **Use socat to redirect ports**:
```bash
# Install socat and redirect traffic
socat TCP-LISTEN:73001,fork TCP:localhost:7301
```
